# YouTube Stock Video Summary by ChatGPT
This project generates a summary report of YouTube videos related to stocks every hour. The summary report is generated using OpenAI's ChatGPT, which is prompted with user-specified keywords related to stocks, such as "US stocks". The resulting summary is then combined with other video statistics, such as views and likes, and displayed on a webpage for easy access.
